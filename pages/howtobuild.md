# How to Build

## Requirements

To build is required:

* JDK 7u25
* make
* gcc4
* Cygwin/MinGW (only for Windows)


## Build binary zip by Gradle

Download and expand GroovyServ source package `groovyserv-0.13-src.zip` to any directory:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/opt/src
$ cd ~/opt/src
$ unzip groovyserv-0.13-src.zip
```

Build with Gradle as follows:

```
$ cd ~/opt/src/groovyserv-0.13
$ ./gradlew
```

Then some zip files will be generated.
According to :ref:`Install from binary package <ref-howtoinstall-binary>`, install the bin package:

```
~/opt/src/groovyserv-0.13/build/distributions/groovyserv-0.13-<OS>-<arch>-bin.zip
```

If some tests fail, please try again with specifying character encoding as follows:

```
$ export _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
$ ./gradlew
```

or to skip all tests:

```
$ ./gradlew clean dist
```

To build in Windows, you need gcc(v4) and MinGW.
You must install them before trying to build.
Then, execute the above commands on Cygwin.


## Build only native groovyclient

There is the Makefile which can build `groovyclient` from C sources.
So you can easily build `groovyclient` binary file as follows:

```
$ cd ~/opt/src/groovyserv-0.13
$ make clean
$ make
```

The binary file is created in `build` directory.
You can copy it whereever you want:

```
~/opt/src/groovyserv-0.13/build/natives/groovyclient      (for Linux / Mac OS X)
~/opt/src/groovyserv-0.13/build/natives/groovyclient.exe  (for Windows)
```

## Build native groovyclient on GVM

`groovyclient` command installed by GVM is a limited shell version.
If you have `make` and `gcc`, you can easily replace it with a native client built by yourself using `groovyserv-setup-nativeclient` command:

```
$ groovyclient -v
Groovy Version: xxxx
GroovyServ Version: Server: 0.13
GroovyServ Version: Client: 0.13 (.sh) [Limited Edition]

$ groovyserv-setup-nativeclient
....
Successfully installed: /xxxx/.gvm/groovyserv/xxxx/bin/groovyclient

$ groovyclient -v
Groovy Version: xxxx
GroovyServ Version: Server: 0.13
GroovyServ Version: Client: 0.13 (.c)
```

## Build RPM file

If you want to install from RPM package, you can build the RPM package by yourself.
The sample SPEC file which is required to build a RPM package was at first contributed by Oliver.
And Kazuhisha updated it. Thank you, Oliver and Kazuhisha!

The samples of SPEC file is in [contrib/rpm-spec](https://github.com/kobo/groovyserv/tree/master/contrib/rpm).

Well, I don't know how to build a RPM package, so I may not be able to support about it.
Sorry in advance ;-)
